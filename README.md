# PLA-Screw-Cap-Design-Software
I iteratively modeled, 3d printed, and tested different screw caps out of PLA until I found the right fit. Then I modeled a formula to consistently give me the right fit, a formula I derived from my testing. I automated the calculations with client side javascript. I then implemented an o-ring to give me a water-tight fit. This is part of a much larger ongoing project. Below is a picture of the final working result of this one:
